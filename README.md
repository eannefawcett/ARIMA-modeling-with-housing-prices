In this repository there are several notebooks. Each of them have a different focus. Housing Investment notebook contains all models explored and should be the first notebook that you visit. In it you will find an evaluation of time series data provided by zillow.com. This evaluation selects the lowest error, best preforming model for selected counties in Texas. Some zipcodes in those counties are worth investing in, others are not.
